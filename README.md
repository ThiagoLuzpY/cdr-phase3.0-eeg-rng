## What is CDR?

**Core Distinguishability Relativity (CDR)** is a pre-registered framework designed to detect information-driven selection bias in observed dynamics without falling into common statistical pitfalls such as p-hacking, circular reasoning, or model over-flexibility.

The framework focuses on answering a fundamental scientific question:

> *When we observe a dynamic system, how do we know whether a detected pattern is a real causal effect or merely an artifact of noise or modeling assumptions?*

CDR addresses this through:

- Pre-registered hypotheses  
- Mandatory validation gates  
- Adversarial and structural controls  
- Out-of-sample generalization tests  

Instead of relying solely on p-values, CDR requires multiple orthogonal validation gates to pass before any claim can be considered detectable.

---

## Project Roadmap

The CDR validation program is divided into empirical phases.

G6_adversarial: PASS
G7_out_of_sample: PASS
────────────────
FINAL: PASS
```

---

## Phase II — Empirical Validation

Phase II tests the framework on real observational systems.

The objective is to verify that the estimator:

- Detects reweighting when present
- Does not produce false positives
- Generalizes across unseen data
- Remains stable under discretization changes

---

```
ε ≈ 0
```

consistent with a highly regulated infrastructure system.

---

## Phase II.1B — Neural Dynamics Validation (Completed)

**Dataset:**
```
OpenNeuro
ds002938
task: effort
subject: sub-01
```

**State construction:**
```
state = (ROI₁, ROI₂, ROI₃, ROI₄, ROI₅)
```

────────────────────────────────
FINAL: PASS
```

---

## Phase II.2 — Human Mobility Validation (Completed)

This phase applies the CDR framework to **large-scale human mobility trajectories**.

---

### Dataset
```
Microsoft GeoLife GPS Trajectories
```

**Characteristics:**
```
182 users
17,000+ trajectories
~1.2 million GPS points
Sampling interval ≈ 1–5 seconds
```

**After preprocessing:**
```
user-level state trajectories
discretized spatial bins
temporal transition sequences
```

---

### System Representation

Human mobility was represented as a discrete dynamical system:
```
state = (spatial_cell_t)
```

**Transitions:**
```
s(t) → s(t+1)
```

Kernel estimated via empirical transition frequencies.

---

### Computational Complexity

This phase required substantially heavier computation than previous domains.

**Pipeline runtime:**
```
~48 hours
```

**Reasons:**

- Large trajectory dataset
- Multiple adversarial controls
- Likelihood surface estimation
- Holdout generalization checks

Control experiments alone required several hours due to repeated recomputation of transition kernels.

---

### Phase II.2 Gates

| Gate | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **F1** | Injection recovery |
| **F2** | Control collapse |
| **F3** | Train/test generalization |
| **F5** | Discretization sensitivity |

---

### Phase II.2 Results

────────────────────────────────
FINAL: PASS
```

---

### Interpretation

The mobility dynamics in the GeoLife dataset appear consistent with a Markovian mobility kernel:
```
ε ≈ 0
```

**Meaning:**

Human spatial transitions in this dataset do not require additional structural mixture beyond the empirical transition kernel.

Importantly, the estimator correctly recovered injected structure:
```
ε_true = 0.30
ε_hat = 0.30
```

confirming estimator sensitivity.

---

## Phase II Conclusions

Across **three independent empirical domains**:

| Domain | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Energy infrastructure | `ε ≈ 0` |
| Neural dynamics (fMRI) | `ε ≈ 0.06–0.08` |
| Human mobility | `ε ≈ 0` |

The CDR estimator demonstrated:

- ✅ Successful injection recovery
- ✅ Collapse under adversarial controls
- ✅ Stable holdout generalization
- ✅ Robustness to discretization

These results support the **cross-domain stability of the CDR estimation framework**.

---

## Objective

Apply the CDR framework to **biological dynamical systems**, specifically:


predator-prey population dynamics


This phase introduces systems with:

- Non-linear feedback loops  
- Cyclical dynamics  
- Strong endogenous structure  

---

## Dataset

```
Hudson Bay Company Lynx–Hare dataset
```

---

## System Representation

Final state definition:

```
state = (hare_log_return, lynx_log_return)
```

---

## Discretization

```
3 bins per variable
3² = 9 states
```

---

## Key Methodological Adjustments

### 1. Dimensionality Correction

year_norm
exogenous variables
```

Reason:

```
avoid sparsity
preserve endogenous structure
```

---

Used:

```
interleaved train/test split
```

Reason:

```
ecological systems are cyclical
chronological split breaks phase consistency
```

---

### 3. Control System (Final)

```
shuffle_time
block_shuffle
species_swap
transition_randomization
```

CDR correctly identifies endogenous structure in biological systems


---

## Updated Phase II Conclusions

| Domain | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Energy infrastructure | ε ≈ 0 |
| Neural dynamics | ε ≈ 0.06–0.08 |
| Human mobility | ε ≈ 0 |

---


# 🔥 NEW — Phase II.4 — Protein Dynamics (Completed)

🔗 **GitHub repository:**
https://github.com/ThiagoLuzpY/cdr-phase2.4-protein

## Objective

Apply the CDR framework to microscopic biological dynamical systems, specifically:

- molecular dynamics simulations
- protein folding trajectories
- conformational state transitions


This phase introduces systems with:

- Energy-landscape-governed transitions

- Strong physical constraints

- Low-dimensional conformational coordinates

- Multiple independent simulation trajectories

---

## Dataset
```
Alanine dipeptide molecular dynamics trajectories
```

Files used:
```
alanine-dipeptide-nowater.pdb
alanine-dipeptide-0-250ns-nowater.xtc
alanine-dipeptide-1-250ns-nowater.xtc
alanine-dipeptide-2-250ns-nowater.xtc
```
---
## System Representation


Protein dynamics were represented through backbone dihedral structure:
```
state = (phi_bin, psi_bin)
```
These variables capture the dominant conformational geometry of alanine dipeptide and provide a compact state-space representation of the molecular dynamics.
---

## Discretization
```
3 bins per variable
3² = 9 states
```
---

## Sampling / Preprocessing

Frame thinning:
```
frame_stride = 10
```

Effective observations loaded:
```
75,000 frames
```
The loader extracted dihedral trajectories from independent molecular dynamics simulations and assembled the conformational variables used in the CDR pipeline.

---

## Key Methodological Adjustment
```
Trajectory-Level Holdout for F3
```
The initial sequential holdout failed because independent .xtc simulations should not be treated as one single continuous trajectory.

---

### Final F3 strategy:
```
leave-one-trajectory-out holdout
```

Implemented as:

- Train on all trajectories except one held-out simulation

- Test on the held-out trajectory only

- Build transitions only within each trajectory

- Prevent artificial transitions across .xtc file boundaries


This adjustment preserved the falsifiability of the framework while aligning the holdout protocol with the physical structure of the dataset.
```
Control System
shuffle_next
circular_shift
block_shuffle
```

These controls were designed to break correct frame-to-frame pairing while preserving partial marginal or short-range structure.

---

────────────────────────────────
FINAL: PASS
Interpretation
```

---

The alanine dipeptide dynamics appear consistent with a structurally sufficient physical kernel:
```
ε ≈ 0
```

Meaning:

- Molecular transitions are largely explained by the endogenous conformational dynamics

- No additional structural reweighting is required at the tested resolution

- The estimator remains sensitive, as shown by successful injected-structure recovery

- Importantly, the final result is consistent with the expectation that strongly constrained molecular systems should behave closer to energy-governed physical dynamics than to partially latent neural systems.

---

## Scientific Insight

This phase confirms that:

- CDR remains stable at the molecular scale

- and that trajectory-aware holdout design is essential when independent simulations are used as empirical test domains.

---

## Updated Phase II Conclusions

Across five independent domains:

| Domain | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Energy infrastructure | ε ≈ 0 |
| Neural dynamics | ε ≈ 0.06–0.08 |
| Human mobility | ε ≈ 0 |
| Ecological systems | ε ≈ 0 |
| Protein dynamics | ε ≈ 0 |

---

The cumulative empirical picture now shows that CDR can distinguish at least two broad classes of systems:

Structurally sufficient systems
```
ε ≈ 0
```

Observed in:

- Energy infrastructure

- Human mobility

- Ecological population dynamics

- Protein dynamics


Partially structurally insufficient systems
```
ε > 0  (low but non-zero)
```

Observed in:

- Neural dynamics (fMRI)

- This supports the interpretation that ε is not a generic marker of randomness, but a domain-sensitive indicator of deviation from structural sufficiency relative to the chosen reference kernel.

---

## Future Validation Domains


### Phase III — Laboratory Experiments

Final validation phase.

**Experiments combining:**
```
EEG recordings
+
quantum random number generators
```

**Objective:**
```
Test whether neural activity correlates with deviations from ideal randomness
under strictly pre-registered experimental conditions
```

This phase transitions from observational data to **controlled experimental validation**.

---
### Domain 1 — EEG

Type of system:
```
direct neural activity
high temporal resolution
richer temporal structure than fMRI
```
Expected ε profile:
```
ε > 0  (low or moderate, if residual neural structure is real)
```
Interpretation target:
```
detect non-trivial residual structure in direct neural dynamics

test whether CDR replicates and sharpens the neural pattern already observed in fMRI

evaluate whether higher temporal resolution yields stronger or cleaner deviation from structural sufficiency
```
---

### Domain 2 — RNG

Type of system:
```
idealized stochastic output
baseline of minimal structural organization
```
Expected ε profile:
```
ε ≈ 0
```
Interpretation target:
```
verify that CDR does not detect spurious structure in a system designed to approximate ideal randomness

establish a strong experimental null domain

demonstrate that the framework distinguishes genuine residual structure from pure stochastic baselines
```
